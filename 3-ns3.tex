\chapter{Network Simulator 3}
\label{sec:ns3}

The \textit{ns-3} simulator is an open, extensible discrete-event network simulator designed primarily 
for educational and network research purposes \cite{ns3}.

In summary, \textit{ns-3} provides models of how packet data networks work and operate, as well as a 
simulation engine that allows users to run simulation experiments. To do research that are 
more difficult or impossible to do with real systems, to examine system behavior in a highly 
controlled, reproducible setting, and to understand about how networks work.

\textit{ns-3} is a collection of modules that can be used together as well as with other software 
libraries. This tool works mainly at the command line on \textit{Linux} or \textit{MacOS} and with 
\textit{C++} and \textit{Python} programming languages and development tools.

\section{Getting Started}
\label{sec:ns3intro}

The prerequisites for the \textit{ns-3} release version 3.32 are the following tools:

Start by downloading the source archive from \href{https://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.32.tar.bz2}{nsnam}
or \href{https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-allinone.git}{gitlab}. Then build \textit{ns-3} with \texttt{build.py}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=myshell,caption={Download and installation of ns-3}, captionpos=b]
  # Download from nsnam
  $ cd
  $ mkdir workspace
  $ cd workspace
  $ wget https://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.32.tar.bz2
  $ |\color{myblue}tar| xjf ns-allinone-3.32.tar.bz2
  $ cd ns-allinone-3.32
  # Building ns-3
  $ ./build.py --enable-examples --enable-tests
