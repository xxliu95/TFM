There is no doubt about the importance of online video streaming.
According to Sandvine \cite{sandvine1},
in 2020, 57\% of the global internet traffic was used by video streaming.
Moreover, one of the key predictions made by Cisco in 2018 \cite{cisco1}
stated that by year 2022, video traffic will make up 82 percent 
of all IP traffic.


Consequently, numerous challenges arise. Due to the
growth of the number and diversity of video capable connected 
devices and every time more available bandwidth and better quality 
contents, the video server needs to adapt the video content to
the network and the devices.
