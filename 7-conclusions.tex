\section{Conclusions}

This Master Thesis have the objectives of building a simulation framework
able to test \textit{ABR} adaptation algorithms in mobile network scenarios,
and comparing different implmentations of existing adaptation algorithms 
based on QoE and fairness metrics.

First, the study begin by familiarizing with the simulation software \textit{ns-3}.
It was really challenging at first, due to the lack of grafical user interface
and relatively small community to help solving problems. After learning scripting
in \textit{ns-3}, implementing new modules in \textit{ns-3} is
