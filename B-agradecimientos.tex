I would like to express my deepest appreciation to my mentor, Marcus, you
have been really pacient with me and this thesis wouldn't be possible 
without your help. I would like to thank Carlos, my supervisor, by giving
me a lot of constructive advices and proofreading my thesis.

Thanks also to my girlfriend, you always have been by my side and made 
this journey more pleasant. I am also very thankful for the company of 
classmates, even though we could not be in class physically this year 
because of the pandemic, but I will remember this stage of life with 
much gratitude.

Lastly, special thanks to Ericsson for the opportunity to do an internship 
during this course and to develop the project for this Master's thesis.
